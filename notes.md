CHAPTER 1

Topic: Introduction to Financial Reporting & Financial Statements


---

1️⃣ What is Financial Reporting?

Financial Reporting = Company apni financial information (performance + position) outside world ko batati hai.
Purpose:

Investors ko decision lena easy ho

Company ne paisa kahan lagaya & paise ka kya result aaya

Future expectations check karna


Key users:

Investors

Lenders

Creditors

Analysts

Regulators

Management (indirectly)


Tiny Points:

Financial reporting future ke bare me estimation allow karta hai.

Historical + current data show karta hai.

Pure data assumptions pe based hota hai, isliye “judgement” use hota hai.



---

2️⃣ Primary Financial Statements (4 main, 1 optional)

1. Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet)

Shows: Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Assets → Company ke paas kya hai

Liabilities → Company kis ko kya deni hai

Equity → Owners ki claim


2. Income Statement (P&L)

Shows:

Revenue

Expenses

Profit or Loss


Formula:
Net Income = Revenue – Expenses

3. Cash Flow Statement

Three parts:

Operating cash flow

Investing cash flow

Financing cash flow


4. Statement of Changes in Equity

Shows:

Opening equity → Closing equity kaise change hua

Dividends

New share issue

Net income impact


5. Notes to Financial Statements (VERY IMPORTANT)

Isme hota hai:

Accounting policies

Assumptions

Breakdown tables

Contingent liabilities

Details jo FS me directly nahi hoti


Exam tip: Notes = hidden gold; most adjustments yahi se milte.


---

3️⃣ Qualitative Characteristics of Financial Information

Fundamental:

1. Relevance

Info useful honi chahiye

Includes: Materiality



2. Faithful representation

Complete

Neutral

Free from error




Enhancing Characteristics:

Comparability

Verifiability

Timeliness

Understandability



---

4️⃣ Financial Reporting Frameworks (IFRS vs GAAP)

IFRS (International)

Principles-based

Flexibility high

Judgement allowed


GAAP (USA)

Rules-based

Specific guidelines

Less flexibility


Tiny Differences:

Inventory LIFO → Allowed in GAAP, forbidden in IFRS

Component depreciation → IFRS requires

Impairment reversal → Only IFRS allows



---

5️⃣ Auditor Opinion Types

1. Unqualified (Clean) → Statements correct


2. Qualified → Minor issue


3. Adverse → Statements wrong


4. Disclaimer → Auditor couldn’t complete audit



Most scoring concept.


---

6️⃣ Accrual vs Cash Basis

Accrual Accounting:

Revenue recognized WHEN earned

Expense recognized WHEN incurred

Not dependent on cash


Cash Accounting:

Record when cash received/paid

Not used for reporting (except small firms)


Why accrual?
Better picture of actual performance.


---

7️⃣ Constraints & Assumptions

Going concern → Company will continue

Accrual basis

Consistency

Prudence / conservatism



---



CHAPTER 2


"This is one of the MOST important chapters. Concepts crystal clear hone chahiye."


---

🔵 1️⃣ Income Statement (Statement of Profit & Loss)

Shows company ka performance over a period:

Formula:
→ Net Income = Revenues – Expenses

Other names:

Profit & Loss Statement (P&L)

Statement of Operations



---

🔵 2️⃣ Income Statement Components (Tiny-to-Tiny)

A) Revenues

Revenue = Economic benefit received from core operations.
Examples:

Sale of goods

Providing services

Interest income (if core business)


Key point:

IFRS: “Revenue recognized when control transfers to customer.”

GAAP: “When performance obligation is satisfied.”



---

B) Expenses

Expenses = Costs used to generate revenues.

Types:

1. COGS – Cost of goods sold


2. Operating expenses

Selling

Admin

Marketing



3. Depreciation & Amortization


4. Interest expense


5. Tax expense




---

🔵 3️⃣ Other Key Terms

1. Gross Profit

Gross Profit = Revenue – COGS

Shows profitability of main business only.


---

2. Operating Income (EBIT)

EBIT = Gross Profit – Operating Expenses

Exam point:
EBIT excludes interest & taxes.


---

3. Net Income

Net Income = EBIT – Interest – Taxes ± Other items

Ye bottom line hota hai.


---

4. Operating vs Non-operating Components

Operating Items:

Revenue

COGS

Operating expenses

Depreciation

R&D


Non-operating Items:

Interest income

Interest expense

Gains/losses from investments

Foreign exchange gains/losses


Exam trick: Operating = core business
Non-operating = non-core business


---

🔵 4️⃣ Formats of Income Statement

A) Single-step Format

No sub-totals
→ Revenue – Expenses = Net Income

Simple but less informative.


---

B) Multi-step Format (MOST IMPORTANT)

Shows:

Gross profit

Operating income

Non-operating items

Net income


Ye analysis ke liye best hai.


---

🔵 5️⃣ Revenue Recognition (VERY IMPORTANT)

IFRS 5 Step Model (Tiny Detail):

1. Customer contract identify karo


2. Performance obligations identify karo


3. Transaction price determine karo


4. Price allocate karo


5. Recognize revenue when obligation satisfied



Example:
Phone + service plan = 2 obligations.


---

🔵 6️⃣ Expense Recognition

Matching Principle:

Expenses ko same period me recognize karo jisme revenue generate hua.

Examples:

Sales commission → same period

Warranty expense → estimate earlier

Depreciation → asset life ke hisaab se



---

🔵 7️⃣ Special Items (Exam Favourite)

1) Gains & Losses

Non-core activities

Example: Machine bechne par profit/loss


2) Unusual or Infrequent Items

Natural disaster loss

Restructuring charges


Not extraordinary (CFA ne ye term hata diya).


---

🔵 8️⃣ Earnings Per Share (EPS)

Basic EPS =

\text{Net Income – Preferred Dividends} \div \text{Weighted Avg. Shares}

Tiny point:
Preferred dividends ALWAYS minus karo.


---

Diluted EPS

Agar stock options, convertible bonds, warrants ho →
Shares increase → EPS decreases.

Formula:

\text{Diluted EPS} = \frac{\text{Adj. Net Income}}{\text{Diluted Shares}}


---

🔵 9️⃣ Common-Size Income Statement

Har line item ko Revenue ke % me convert karte hai.
Helps in:

Trend analysis

Cross-company comparison


Example:
COGS = 60% of revenue, EBIT = 15%


---

🔵 🔟 Revenue Manipulation Red Flags (Tiny Points)

Aggressive revenue recognition

Bill-and-hold sales

Channel stuffing

Huge increase in receivables

Inconsistent revenue vs cash flow



CHAPTER 3

Ye chapter CFA me BOHOT important hai — assets/liabilities ke valuation, adjustments, ratios… sab yahi se aate hain.


---

📘 FSA – CHAPTER 3 NOTES (BALANCE SHEET / STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION)

"This chapter tells you WHAT the company owns and OWES at a specific date."


---

🔵 1️⃣ What is a Balance Sheet?

Balance Sheet shows:

Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Assets: What company owns
Liabilities: What company owes
Equity: Owners’ claim

Key features:

Covers a point in time (not a period)

Helps evaluate liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility



---

🔵 2️⃣ Structure of a Balance Sheet

A) Assets

Divided into:

1. Current Assets

Converted to cash within 1 year.
Includes:

Cash & cash equivalents

Marketable securities

Accounts receivable

Inventory

Prepaid expenses


Tiny points:

Cash equivalents = highly liquid investments (T-bills)

AR shown net of allowance for doubtful accounts


2. Non-current Assets

Long-term >1 year.
Includes:

Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E)

Intangible assets

Goodwill

Long-term investments

Deferred tax assets



---

B) Liabilities

1. Current Liabilities

Due within 1 year.
Examples:

Accounts payable

Short-term debt

Interest payable

Income tax payable

Unearned revenue (important)


2. Non-current Liabilities

Due >1 year.
Examples:

Long-term debt

Bonds payable

Lease liabilities

Deferred tax liabilities



---

C) Equity

Represents owners' interest.
Includes:

Common stock

Additional paid-in capital

Retained earnings

Treasury stock (negative equity)

Other comprehensive income (OCI)



---

🔵 3️⃣ Measurement Bases (MOST IMPORTANT)

Assets & liabilities ko 4 methods se measure karte hain:

1. Historical Cost

Original purchase price
Example: Machines, land
No adjustment unless impaired

2. Fair Value (Market Value)

Current market price
Used for:

Trading securities

Some investments


3. Amortized Cost

Historical cost minus amortization
Used for:

Bonds held to maturity

LT receivables


4. Present Value

Future cash flows discounted to today
Used for:

Long-term liabilities



---

🔵 4️⃣ Major Asset Categories (Detailed)

A) PP&E (Property, Plant & Equipment)

Tangible long-term assets used in operations.

PP&E measured at:

Cost Model (IFRS/GAAP): Cost – Depreciation – Impairment

Revaluation Model (IFRS only): Adjust to fair value regularly


Tiny points:

GAAP doesn’t allow revaluation.

Land is not depreciated.



---

B) Intangible Assets

Examples:

Patents

Copyrights

Trademarks


Internally generated intangibles (Brand, reputation)

→ Expensed, capitalized nahi hote.

Purchased intangibles

→ Capitalized


---

C) Goodwill

Paid price > fair value of net assets.

Important:

Goodwill is not amortized

BUT impaired hota hai (annual test)

Impairment cannot be reversed under GAAP



---

D) Inventory Valuation

Methods:

FIFO

Weighted average

LIFO (only GAAP allowed)


Tiny points:

In inflation: FIFO → higher profit, LIFO → lower profit

LIFO reserve = FIFO – LIFO inventory



---

🔵 5️⃣ Liability Details (Important)

A) Short-term liabilities

Appear at settlement value.
Examples:

AP

ST borrowings

Unearned revenue (customer has paid, but service not delivered)



---

B) Long-term liabilities

Measured using present value.

Examples:

Bonds payable

Issued at premium/discount


Lease liabilities

Pension liabilities



---

🔵 6️⃣ Equity Components (Simple + Important)

1. Common Stock

Face value of shares issued.

2. Additional Paid-in Capital (APIC)

Amount received above face value.

3. Retained Earnings

Cumulative profits – dividends.

4. Treasury Stock

Company buys back its own shares.
Shown as negative equity.

5. OCI (Other Comprehensive Income)

Items not in income statement:

FX translation gains

Unrealized gains on securities

Pension adjustments



---

🔵 7️⃣ Liquidity & Solvency Ratios (Exam GOLD)

Liquidity Ratios

1. Current Ratio



\text{Current Assets} / \text{Current Liabilities}

2. Quick Ratio



\frac{\text{CA – Inventory}}{\text{CL}}

3. Cash Ratio



\frac{\text{Cash + Securities}}{\text{CL}}


---

Solvency Ratios

1. Debt-to-Equity



\text{Total Debt} / \text{Total Equity}

2. Debt Ratio



\text{Total Debt} / \text{Total Assets}

3. Interest Coverage



\text{EBIT} / \text{Interest Expense}


---

🔵 8️⃣ Balance Sheet Limitations

Many assets recorded at historical cost

Internally generated intangibles not recorded

Judgements & estimates used (depreciation, allowance)



---


CHAPTER 4

Ye chapter bohot scoring hota hai — agar ye perfect hua toh FSA 40% easier lagne lagega.


---

📘 FSA – CHAPTER 4 NOTES (CASH FLOW STATEMENT – FULL DETAILED)

"The cash flow statement tells you where cash CAME from and where it WENT."


---

🔵 1️⃣ Purpose of Cash Flow Statement

Shows cash inflows & outflows during a period.

Helps evaluate:

Liquidity

Solvency

Company ki real cash-generating ability

Earnings quality (cash vs accrual differences)



---

🔵 2️⃣ Three Sections of Cash Flow Statement

1. Cash Flow from Operating Activities (CFO)

Cash from core business operations.

Examples (Inflows):

Cash received from customers

Interest received

Dividends received


Examples (Outflows):

Payments to suppliers

Wages

Taxes paid

Interest paid



---

2. Cash Flow from Investing Activities (CFI)

Cash from long-term investments.

Examples (Inflows):

Selling PP&E

Selling investments

Collecting loan principal


Examples (Outflows):

Purchase of PP&E

Purchase of long-term investments

Giving loans



---

3. Cash Flow from Financing Activities (CFF)

Cash related to capital structure.

Examples (Inflows):

Issuing shares

Borrowing money

Issuing bonds


Examples (Outflows):

Share buybacks

Dividend payments

Loan principal repayment



---

🔵 3️⃣ Direct vs Indirect Method (MOST IMPORTANT)

Direct Method:

Lists cash inflows and outflows directly.
E.g.

Cash received from customers

Cash paid to suppliers


CFA me simple method.


---

Indirect Method:

Start with Net income → Adjust for non-cash items.

Formula:

\text{CFO} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Non-cash expenses} + \text{Changes in working capital}

Adjustments:

1. Non-cash items:

Depreciation


Amortization


Losses


– Gains


2. Working Capital changes:

Increase in AR → minus (cash not received)

Decrease in AR → plus

Increase in AP → plus (cash saved)

Increase in inventory → minus

Decrease in inventory → plus



---

🔵 4️⃣ Interest & Dividends Classification (IFRS vs GAAP – VERY important)

IFRS:

Interest Received → CFO or CFI

Interest Paid → CFO or CFF

Dividends Received → CFO or CFI

Dividends Paid → CFF


GAAP:

Interest Received → CFO

Interest Paid → CFO

Dividends Received → CFO

Dividends Paid → CFF


Exam trick:
GAAP = fixed categories
IFRS = flexible categories


---

🔵 5️⃣ Calculating CFO from Indirect Method (Examples)

Start with Net Income

Depreciation

Loss on sale of asset
– Gain on sale
– Increase in AR
– Increase in Inventory

Increase in AP



---

🔵 6️⃣ Asset sale effect on CFS

Example: Machine sold for 12,000
Book value = 10,000 → Gain = 2,000

CFO:

-2,000 (subtract gain)

CFI:

+12,000 inflow

(Exam favourite concept)


---

🔵 7️⃣ Free Cash Flow (VERY HIGH-YIELD)

1) Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)

\text{FCFF} = \text{CFO} + \text{Interest}(1 - \text{Tax Rate}) - \text{CapEx}

2) Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)

\text{FCFE} = \text{CFO} - \text{CapEx} + \text{Net Borrowing}

Where:

Net Borrowing = New debt – Debt repayment


Interpretation:

FCFF → available to ALL investors

FCFE → available to equity holders



---

🔵 8️⃣ Quality of Earnings Indicators

Red flags:

Net income high but CFO low → earnings manipulation possible

Large increase in receivables

Frequent restructuring charges

CFO < Net income continuously



---

🔵 9️⃣ Common-Size CFS

Each component is expressed as a % of total cash inflows.

Used for:

Trend analysis

Comparing firms



---

🔵 🔟 Limitations of CFS

Does not capture non-cash transactions

Management can manipulate timing of payments

Very volatile year to year



---


CHAPTER 5

Ye chapter wo hai jisse exam me direct 8–12 marks nikalte hain.

I’ll give you tiny-to-tiny, formula-by-formula, interpretation-by-interpretation notes.


---

📘 FSA – CHAPTER 5 NOTES (FINANCIAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES)


---

🔵 1️⃣ Financial Ratios – Why Used?

Ratios help in:

Company performance compare karna

Trend identify karna

Strength/weakness nikalna

Liquidity & solvency check

Profitability judge karna


Types:

1. Liquidity


2. Solvency


3. Activity


4. Profitability


5. Valuation




---

🔵 2️⃣ Liquidity Ratios (Very Scoring)

Measure short-term capacity to pay liabilities.

1. Current Ratio

\frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}

High = good liquidity
Low = risk


---

2. Quick Ratio / Acid Test

\frac{\text{CA – Inventory}}{CL}

Inventory remove because it's less liquid.


---

3. Cash Ratio

\frac{\text{Cash + Marketable Securities}}{CL}

Most conservative ratio.


---

🔵 3️⃣ Solvency Ratios (Long-term Risk)

1. Debt-to-Equity

\frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Equity}}

High ratio = high leverage = risky.


---

2. Debt Ratio

\frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Assets}}

Shows % assets financed by debt.


---

3. Interest Coverage

\frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expense}}

Measures ability to pay interest.

Higher = safer.


---

🔵 4️⃣ Activity Ratios (Efficiency Ratios)

1. Inventory Turnover

\frac{COGS}{Average\ Inventory}

High turnover = goods sell fast.


---

2. Days of Inventory

\frac{365}{\text{Inventory Turnover}}

Days inventory stays in stock.


---

3. Receivable Turnover

\frac{\text{Revenue}}{Avg\ AR}


---

4. Days of Sales Outstanding (DSO)

\frac{365}{\text{Receivable Turnover}}

Lower = faster collection.


---

5. Payable Turnover

\frac{COGS}{Avg\ AP}


---

6. Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)

\frac{365}{\text{Payable Turnover}}

High DPO = company pays suppliers slowly = good for cash flow.


---

7. Total Asset Turnover

\frac{\text{Revenue}}{\text{Total Assets}}

High = better utilization.


---

🔵 5️⃣ Profitability Ratios (HIGH Yield)

1. Gross Margin

\frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Revenue}}


---

2. Operating Margin

\frac{\text{Operating\ Income}}{\text{Revenue}}


---

3. Net Profit Margin

\frac{\text{Net\ Income}}{\text{Revenue}}


---

4. Return on Assets (ROA)

\frac{\text{Net\ Income}}{\text{Total\ Assets}}


---

5. Return on Equity (ROE)

\frac{\text{Net\ Income}}{\text{Shareholder\ Equity}}

ROE is most important profitability ratio.


---

🔵 6️⃣ DuPont Analysis (VERY VERY IMPORTANT)

Breaks ROE into parts.

3-step DuPont:

ROE = Net\ Profit\ Margin × Asset\ Turnover × Financial\ Leverage

Where:

Net Profit Margin = NI / Sales

Asset Turnover = Sales / Assets

Leverage = Assets / Equity


Interpretation:

ROE high kyun hai? Profitability? Efficiency? Leverage?
DuPont se answer milta hai.



---

🔵 7️⃣ Common-Size Analysis

Change FS into percentages:

Income Statement:

Every item = % of Revenue

Balance Sheet:

Every item = % of Total Assets

Used for:

Comparing different size companies

Trend analysis



---

🔵 8️⃣ Vertical vs Horizontal Analysis

Vertical:

Single year → all items expressed as % of revenue or total assets.

Horizontal:

Year-to-year change → percentage change.


---

🔵 9️⃣ Adjustments for Fair Analysis (CFA LOVES THIS)

Important adjustments to compare companies correctly:

1. LIFO to FIFO Conversion

GAAP uses LIFO; convert to FIFO using:

FIFO\ Inventory = LIFO\ Inventory + LIFO\ Reserve

FIFO\ COGS = LIFO\ COGS - \Delta LIFO\ Reserve


---

2. Capitalizing Operating Leases

Operating lease → convert to Finance lease for proper analysis.

Effects:

Assets ↑

Liabilities ↑

EBIT ↑

Net income ↓ in early years



---

3. Removing non-recurring items

Restructuring charges
One-time losses
Discontinued operations
→ Clean comparison.


---

4. Classification Adjustments

Interest paid
Interest received
Dividends
IFRS vs GAAP classification difference.


---

🔵 🔟 Earnings Quality Indicators (Exam Red Flags)

Net income ↑ but CFO ↓

Large receivables growth

Frequent non-recurring gains/losses

Big changes in provisions

Very low depreciation expense



---


CHAPTER 6

Understanding Financial Reporting Standards

(Zero-to-Master Detailed Notes)


---

⭐ 1. Financial Reporting Standards (FRS) kya hote hain?

Financial Reporting Standards =
Rules + principles jo companies ko financial statements banate waqt follow karne padte hain.

Purpose:

Consistency

Transparency

Comparability

Investor protection

Fraud prevent


Tiny point:
👉 Standard ke bina FS kisi ka “personal style” ban jaate — no comparability, no trust.


---

⭐ 2. Standard-Setting Bodies

(A) IASB — International Accounting Standards Board

IFRS banata hai

Global standards

140+ countries follow


IASB ke objectives:

1. High-quality, understandable, globally accepted standards


2. Transparency in FS


3. Reduce information asymmetry


4. Bring consistency in markets



Tiny point:
IASB ka framework = Conceptual Framework, jisme definitions + recognition criteria + measurement bases hote hain.


---

(B) FASB — Financial Accounting Standards Board

USA ka standard setting body

GAAP banata hai

SEC isko oversee karta hai


Comparison tiny:
IFRS = principle-based
GAAP = rule-based


---

⭐ 3. Regulatory Authorities (Not Standard Makers)

SEC – U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission

GAAP follow karwana

Financial reporting monitor karna

Fraud prevent

Investors ko protect karna


SEC khud standards NHI banata —
ye FASB ke standards ko mandatory banata.


---

⭐ 4. IFRS vs GAAP Quick Tiny Differences

Area	IFRS	GAAP

Inventory	LIFO allowed nahi	LIFO allowed
R&D	Research expensed, Development capitalizable	Mostly expensed
Revaluation	PPE revaluation allowed	Not allowed
Impairment	Reversal allowed	Not allowed



---

⭐ 5. Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting

IASB ka backbone.

Main Objectives:

Provide useful information to investors, lenders, creditors


Qualitative Characteristics:

(A) Fundamental

1. Relevance

Predictive value

Confirmatory value

Materiality



2. Faithful Representation

Complete

Neutral

Free from error




(B) Enhancing

Comparability

Verifiability

Timeliness

Understandability


Tiny trick:
👉 Relevance = future related
Faithful = truth related


---

⭐ 6. Constraints on Financial Reporting

Cost vs Benefit

Materiality

Prudence (IFRS main subtle way se allowed)

Going concern assumption



---

⭐ 7. Financial Statement Elements

Assets – Present resource controlling future benefit
Liabilities – Present obligation
Equity – Residual
Income – Increase in assets or decrease in liabilities
Expenses – Decrease in assets or increase in liabilities


---

⭐ 8. Recognition Criteria

Koi cheez FS me tabhi record hoti hai jab:

1. Future economic benefit probable ho


2. Measurement reliable ho




---

⭐ 9. Measurement Bases (VERY important)

1. Historical Cost


2. Fair Value


3. Amortized Cost


4. Value in Use


5. Current Cost



Example:

Land often → historical cost

Derivatives → fair value

Bonds → amortized cost



---

⭐ 10. Barriers to a Single Global Standard

Political pressure

Economic differences between countries

Legal systems

Cultural attitudes

Lobbying groups



---

⭐ 11. Convergence of IFRS and GAAP

Goal: ek common standard
BUT
Full convergence impossible because:

U.S. political system resistant

Legal liability fears

Domestic economic issues


Still, many standards already harmonized (revenue, leases, business combinations).


---

⭐ 12. Importance of Financial Reporting Standards for CFA

Equity valuation

Fixed income analysis

Corporate issuers

Portfolio allocation

Comparability across global markets



---


CHAPTER 7

Financial Reporting Mechanics

(Zero-to-Master, tiniest-to-tiniest detailed notes, bilkul CFA-style)


---

⭐ 1. Financial Reporting Mechanics kya hota hai?

Is chapter ka main aim:
“Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement — in sab ka system kaise work karta hai, transactions FS me kaise flow hote hain.”

Ye chapter tumhara FSA ka engine hai.
Isko samajh loge → poora subject easy ho jayega.


---

⭐ 2. Accounting Equation (THE BASE)

Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Always balanced.
Har transaction do jagah affect karta hai → double-entry bookkeeping.


---

⭐ 3. Double-Entry Accounting (Super Tiny but MOST important)

Rules:

Every debit = equal credit

Debit ≠ negative

Credit ≠ positive

Debit aur credit BAS labels hain


Debit increases:

Assets

Expenses

Dividends


Credit increases:

Liabilities

Equity

Revenue


Memory hack:
👉 DEAD: Debit ↑ Expenses, Assets, Dividends


---

⭐ 4. Expanded Accounting Equation

Assets = Liabilities + Contributed Capital + Beginning Equity + Revenue – Expenses – Dividends

Issi ko hum “owner's equity” dekh kar samajhte.


---

⭐ 5. "T-Accounts" (CFA exam favourite)

Transaction ko samajhne ke liye T-shape chart:

Account Name
     -----------------
     Debit | Credit

Example:
Company ne ₹20,000 ka equipment cash se kharida.

Equipment (Asset)
Debit 20,000

Cash (Asset)
Credit 20,000

Donon side effect → balanced.


---

⭐ 6. Steps in the Financial Reporting Process

1. Journal entries


2. Post to ledger (T-accounts)


3. Trial balance prepare


4. Adjusting entries (VERY important)


5. Adjusted trial balance


6. Financial statements


7. Closing entries


8. Post-closing trial balance




---

⭐ 7. Adjusting Entries (Most confusing for students—here simplified)

Kab?

Period-end pe.

Kyu?

So that revenue & expenses correct period me reflect ho.

5 Types:

1) Accrued Revenue

Earned → cash later
(Example: interest earned but not received)

2) Accrued Expense

Incurred → cash later
(Example: salary payable)

3) Deferred Revenue

Cash mila → service baad me
(Example: subscription)

4) Deferred Expense (Prepaid)

Cash diya → benefit baad me
(Example: prepaid rent)

5) Depreciation

Asset ki slow expense recording

Tiny point:
Depreciation cash CFS ko affect nahi karta.


---

⭐ 8. The Three Main Financial Statements (Mechanics)


---

📌 (A) Income Statement Formula Flow

1. Revenue


2. – COGS


3. = Gross Profit


4. – Operating Expenses


5. = Operating Income


6. ± Non-operating Items


7. = Income Before Tax


8. – Tax


9. = Net Income



Net income automatically equity me flow hota hai → Retained Earnings.


---

📌 (B) Balance Sheet Mechanics

Assets

Current assets

Non-current assets


Liabilities

Current liabilities

Non-current liabilities


Equity

Share capital

Retained earnings (NI – dividends)


Tiny point:
Closing Retained Earnings =
Opening RE + Net Income – Dividends


---

📌 (C) Cash Flow Statement Links

3 sections:

1. CFO


2. CFI


3. CFF



Direct relation:

Net income (IS) → CFO start

PPE purchase (BS asset increase) → CFI outflow

New equity issued (Equity ↑) → CFF inflow



---

⭐ 9. Relationships Between FS (IMPORTANT!!!)

Income Statement → Balance Sheet

Net Income → Retained Earnings ↑

Balance Sheet → Cash Flow

Changes in assets & liabilities → cash flow adjust

Cash Flow → Balance Sheet

Ending cash from CFS = Cash in BS

Ye 3 statements interconnected ecosystem hain.


---

⭐ 10. Accrual Accounting vs Cash Accounting

Accrual	Cash

Revenue jab earned	Revenue jab cash milta
Expense jab incurred	Expense jab cash diya
More accurate	Distorted picture
IFRS/GAAP required	Not accepted



---

⭐ 11. Chart of Accounts (Tiny definition)

Company ka list of all accounts → e.g. Cash, AR, AP, Inventory.


---

⭐ 12. Non-Current Liabilities & Assets ka impact

Examples:

Equipment ↑ → Cash ↓

Bonds payable ↑ → Cash ↑

Depreciation ↑ → Asset ↓, Expense ↑



---

⭐ 13. Common Mistakes CFA Students Make (Tum avoid karogi)

❌ Debit = negative samjhna
❌ Cash flow ko income samajhna
❌ Prepaid ko expense treat karna
❌ Unearned revenue ko revenue treat karna
❌ Depreciation cash flow ko change karta hai sochna


---

⭐ 14. TRICKY EXAMPLE (Exam style)

Company ne ₹1,00,000 ka equipment buy kiya.
Down payment ₹20,000 cash + loan ₹80,000.

Debit: Equipment 1,00,000
Credit: Cash 20,000
Credit: Loan Payable 80,000

Balance sheet impact:

Assets: +1,00,000 – 20,000 = +80,000

Liabilities: +80,000

Equity: No change


Equation balanced.


---

⭐ 15. Closing Entries (Year End)

Income & expense accounts → Retained Earnings me close hoti hain.

Reason:
Next year fresh start with zero balances.



CHAPTER 8

Income Statement

(Complete deep notes, CFA L1 standard)


---

⭐ 1. Income Statement Kya Hoti Hai?

Income statement = Company ka performance report over a period.

Formula:

Net Income = Revenues – Expenses + Gains – Losses

📌 Yeh period-based hota hai (quarter/year).


---

⭐ 2. Revenue (MOST IMPORTANT)

Definition (IFRS)

Revenue =
Inflows from delivering goods or services in ordinary course of business.

IFRS 15 ka 5-step model (TINY EXAM FAVOURITE)

1. Contract identify karo


2. Performance obligations identify karo


3. Transaction price determine karo


4. Price ko obligations me allocate karo


5. Revenue jab control transfer ho → record karo



👉 IFRS me control-based
👉 GAAP me pehle “risk & reward” tha, ab mostly IFRS jaisa ho gaya.


---

⭐ 3. Expense Recognition

Matching Principle:

Expense should be recorded in the same period as the revenue it helped generate.

Examples:

COGS = direct matching

Depreciation = systematic allocation

Rent = period cost


❌ Cash basis nahi — accrual basis.


---

⭐ 4. Components of Income Statement

1️⃣ Revenue / Sales

Revenue from normal operations (ex: Amazon = product sales).

2️⃣ COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)

Ye manufacturing or trading cost hoti hai.

Formula:
COGS = Opening Inventory + Purchases – Closing Inventory

3️⃣ Gross Profit

Gross Profit = Revenue – COGS

4️⃣ Operating Expenses

Selling expenses

Administrative expenses

R&D

Depreciation

Marketing


5️⃣ Operating Income / EBIT

EBIT = Gross Profit – Operating Expenses

6️⃣ Non-operating items

Interest income

Interest expense

Gain/Loss on sale of asset

FX gains


7️⃣ Pretax Income

EBIT – Interest Expense + Other Income

8️⃣ Tax Expense

Depend on tax laws.

9️⃣ Net Income

Bottom line = Net Profit
Jise Retained Earnings me add kiya jata hai.


---

⭐ 5. Special Items (Exam Favorite)

(A) Unusual or Infrequent Items

Infrequent events

Example: restructuring charges, asset write-down


Operating me include hote hain.


---

(B) Discontinued Operations

A business segment jo permanently close ho gaya

Income statement me separately show hota hai

AFTER tax



---

(C) Extraordinary Items (IMPORTANT)

IFRS + US GAAP — now abolished
Exam trick:
👉 Agar item “extraordinary” bola ho → WRONG.


---

(D) Changes in Accounting Policy

Retrospective adjust

Example: FIFO → Weighted avg



---

(E) Changes in Accounting Estimates

Prospectively

Example: useful life change



---

⭐ 6. Basic EPS (Earnings per Share)

EPS = Net Income – Preferred Dividends
--------------------------------------
Weighted Avg Shares Outstanding

Example:
Net income = ₹100k
Preferred dividend = ₹20k
Shares = 10,000

EPS = (100k – 20k)/10,000 = ₹8 per share


---

⭐ 7. Diluted EPS

Agar company ke paas convertible bonds, stock options, warrants ho → dilution possible.

Diluted EPS ≤ Basic EPS (always).


---

⭐ 8. Common-Size Income Statement

Har line item = % of Revenue

Example:
COGS = 60%
Operating expenses = 20%
Tax = 10%

Helps compare across companies.


---

⭐ 9. Gross Profit Margin, Net Profit Margin

GPM = Gross Profit / Revenue

NPM = Net Profit / Revenue

Exam often gives IS + asks margin.


---

⭐ 10. IFRS vs GAAP (FAST revision)

Topic	IFRS	GAAP

R&D	Research expensed, development capitalized	Mostly expensed
Revenue	Control-based	Similar but more rules
Extraordinary items	Not allowed	Not allowed now
Format	No fixed format	Multi-step allowed



---

⭐ 11. Revenue Manipulation Red Flags

Channel stuffing

Bill-and-hold sales

Aggressive revenue timing

Unrealistic receivables growth

Increase in DSO



---

⭐ 12. Expense Manipulation Red Flags

Capitalizing expenses

Delaying write-downs

Cookie jar reserves

Sudden gross margin spikes



---

⭐ 13. Comprehensive Income

Includes items NOT in net income.

Examples:

FX translation gains

Unrealized gains on AFS securities

Pension remeasurements


Reported in:
Statement of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)


---

⭐ 14. Multi-step vs Single-step Income Statement

Single-step:

Revenue – Expenses (simple)

Multi-step:

Separates operating & non-operating
(Easier for analysis)

CFA uses multi-step format mostly.


---

⭐ 15. Exam Tricks for Income Statement

✔ Depreciation = non-cash
✔ Net income → Retained Earnings ↑
✔ Revenue at delivery (IFRS 15 rule)
✔ Unusual items = operating
✔ Discontinued ops = separate, after tax
✔ Extraordinary = not allowed
✔ If company capitalizes costs → short-term profit ↑ but long-term expenses ↑
✔ COGS impact inventory method se aata hai (Ch 12 link)


---


CHAPTER 9

Balance Sheet

(Complete detailed notes)


---

⭐ 1. Balance Sheet Kya Hai?

Balance Sheet = Financial position at a point in time
(Income statement time period hota hai, BS snapshot hota hai.)

Formula (must know):
Assets = Liabilities + Equity


---

⭐ 2. Classification of Balance Sheet Items

▶ A. Assets

1) Current Assets

Jo 1 year ya operating cycle me cash ban jayenge:

Cash

Marketable securities

Accounts receivable

Inventory

Prepaid expenses


2) Non-current Assets

PPE

Intangible assets

Goodwill

Long-term investments

Deferred tax assets



---

▶ B. Liabilities

1) Current Liabilities

Accounts payable

Wages payable

Accrued expenses

Unearned revenue

Short-term borrowings


2) Non-current Liabilities

Bonds payable

Lease liabilities

Deferred tax liabilities

Pension obligations



---

▶ C. Equity

Common stock

Additional paid-in capital

Retained earnings

Treasury stock (contra equity)

Accumulated OCI


Retained Earnings Formula:
RE = Opening RE + Net Income – Dividends


---

⭐ 3. Measurement Bases (VERY IMPORTANT)

Balance sheet items kis value pe record hote hain:

Measurement	Meaning

Historical Cost	Original price paid
Fair Value	Market value today
Amortized Cost	Cost – principal paid + interest adjustments
Net Realizable Value	Selling price – selling cost
Value in Use	PV of future cash flows


Examples:

PPE → Historical cost (or revaluation under IFRS)

Inventory → Lower of cost or NRV

Bonds → Amortized cost

Derivatives → Fair value



---

⭐ 4. Financial Assets (VERY CFA Important)

Categories under IFRS:

1. Amortized Cost (hold to collect cash flows)


2. FVOCI (fair value through OCI)


3. FVTPL (fair value through P&L)



Examples:

Trading securities → FVTPL

Bonds held for long-term → Amortized cost

AFS-like instruments → FVOCI



---

⭐ 5. Inventory (Short Summary — full detail Ch 12)

Cost Methods:

FIFO

Weighted Average

Specific identification

LIFO (only GAAP allowed)


IFRS:

LIFO not allowed

Lower of cost or NRV


GAAP:

Lower of cost or Market

Market = replacement cost (bounded)



---

⭐ 6. PPE (Property, Plant & Equipment)

Initial Measurement:

Cost = purchase price + directly attributable costs

Subsequent:

IFRS:

Cost model (like GAAP)

Revaluation model allowed


GAAP:

Only cost model


Depreciation:

Straight-line, declining balance, units of production.


---

⭐ 7. Intangible Assets

Internally created intangibles:

IFRS: Research expensed, development may be capitalized

GAAP: Mostly expensed


Purchased intangibles:

Capitalized.

Goodwill:

Goodwill = Purchase price – Fair value of net assets.

Goodwill impairment allowed, reversal not allowed.


---

⭐ 8. Leases (Right-of-Use Assets)

Both IFRS & GAAP:

Lease liability = PV of lease payments

ROU asset recognized

Short-term leases may be expensed



---

⭐ 9. Deferred Tax Assets & Liabilities (Tiny overview)

Deferred Tax Asset (DTA)

Future tax saving
Example: warranty expense allowed later

Deferred Tax Liability (DTL)

Future tax payment
Example: accelerated depreciation


---

⭐ 10. Financial Statement Presentation Differences

Classified Balance Sheet

Separate current & non-current items
(Preferred by analysts)

Liquidity-Based Balance Sheet

Used in banks; shows items ranked by liquidity.


---

⭐ 11. Balance Sheet Ratios

Liquidity Ratios

1) Current Ratio

CR = Current Assets / Current Liabilities

2) Quick Ratio

QR = (Cash + AR + Marketable Securities) / CL

3) Cash Ratio

= Cash / CL


---

Solvency Ratios

1) Debt-to-Equity

= Total Debt / Total Equity

2) Debt Ratio

= Total Debt / Total Assets

3) Financial Leverage

= Total Assets / Total Equity


---

⭐ 12. Off-Balance Sheet Items

Operating leases (old GAAP)

SPEs (Special Purpose Entities)

Factoring of receivables

Securitization


Analyst ko careful rehna hota hai.


---

⭐ 13. Common-Size Balance Sheet (VERY useful)

Har item = % of total assets.

Example:
Inventory = 25%
Receivables = 15%
Equity = 40%

Helps in cross-company comparison.


---

⭐ 14. Major Red Flags on Balance Sheet

Inventory rising faster than sales

Receivables rising → weak collections

Sudden jump in intangibles → aggressive capitalization

Very high goodwill → overpayment in acquisitions

Low cash + rising short-term debt

PPE revaluation (IFRS) → income smoothing possible



---

⭐ 15. Linking BS with IS and CFS (MOST IMPORTANT)

Net income → equity (RE) ↑

Depreciation → asset ↓, but non-cash

Inventory changes → affect CFO

Accounts payable changes → affects CFO

PPE purchase → affects CFI

New equity issue → affects CFF



---

CHAPTER 10

Financial Reporting Quality Issues (FULL DETAILED NOTES)

(Zero se leke CFA-level clarity)


---

1️⃣ What is Financial Reporting Quality?

Financial reporting quality =
How faithfully, clearly, and completely financial statements show the true economic reality of a business.

Agar statements reality ko sahi dikhaye → High quality
Agar statements overstate/understate kare, manipulate kare → Low quality

⭐ Purpose of high-quality reporting

Investors ko correct picture mile

Comparability hoti hai

Forecasting easy hota hai

Risk kam hota hai



---

2️⃣ Two Concepts You MUST NOT Confuse

CFA isliye baar-baar highlight karta hai:

(A) Reporting Quality (Financial statements how much are right?)

→ IFRS/GAAP follow hua?
→ Accruals clean hain?
→ Judgements realistic?
→ Info complete?

(B) Earnings Quality (Reported earnings kitne sustainable + repeatable hai?)

→ Current earnings genuinely strong hain
→ Future me continue ho payenge?
→ Ek-time gains nahi?

👉 High reporting quality ≠ High earnings quality
Example:
Company IFRS follow karti hai (high reporting quality) but earnings weak (low earnings quality).


---

3️⃣ What Is “Earnings Management”?

Management deliberately earnings ko adjust kare for:

stock price boost

bonuses

meeting analysts forecasts

tax reduction

loan covenants meet karna


⭐ Note: Earnings management ≠ Always fraud

Sometimes within GAAP

Sometimes outside GAAP → outright fraudulent



---

4️⃣ Earnings Management Tools

(VERY important for exam)

1. Income Shifting

➡ Revenue ya expense future/past me shift karna.

Example:

Early revenue recognition (“bill-and-hold sales”)

Delaying expenses (R&D capitalize karna)



---

2. Classification Shifting

➡ Operating items ko non-operating banana to improve core profit.

Example:
Loss on sale of asset → “non-operating” mein shift so operating profit looks better.


---

3. Cookie-Jar Reserves

➡ Tough years me expenses overstate kar do →
Next years me expenses reverse → profits artificially high.


---

4. Big Bath Accounting

➡ Ek baar me huge losses record kar do taaki future profits clean lage.


---

5. Aggressive Accounting

➡ GAAP allowed hai but optimistic assumptions.
Example:

Low allowance for doubtful accounts

Low depreciation

High salvage value

Long useful life



---

6. Fraudulent Reporting

➡ Illegal.
Examples:

Fake revenue

Fake inventory

Understated liabilities



---

5️⃣ Indicators / Red Flags of Low Reporting Quality

1. Unexplained revenue growth

Revenue ↑ but:

no cash flow

no asset growth

no customers


2. High accruals

Accruals = Earnings – Cash flow
→ Higher accruals = Lower quality earnings

3. Frequent one-time items

Har saal “exceptional”, “non-recurring” items aa rahe → suspicious.

4. Changing accounting policies frequently

5. Large related-party transactions

6. Significant jump in margins without reason

7. Mismatch between inventory growth & sales growth

8. Large capitalized expenses

Especially R&D, software development, interest capitalization.


---

6️⃣ Beneish M-Score (Fraud Detection Model)

(Yeh CFA favourite model hai.)

Formula yaad rakhne ki zaroorat nahi.
Bas purpose:

➡ Detects probability of earnings manipulation using 8 ratios.

Most important ratios:

DSRI – Days sales receivable index

AQI – Asset quality index

SGI – Sales growth index

GMI – Gross margin index

TATA – Total accruals to total assets


Key rule:
M-score > –2.22 → Possible manipulator


---

7️⃣ Accounting Warning Signs (By Section)

📌 Revenue Recognition Red Flags

Bill-and-hold

Channel stuffing (extra goods to distributors)

Round-tripping (fake sales)

Long-term contracts manipulated



---

📌 Expense Recognition Red Flags

Capitalizing expenses

Understating warranty or bad debts

Depreciation changes (useful life ↑)



---

📌 Inventory Issues

FIFO vs LIFO switching

Write-down delays

Obsolete inventory not written off



---

📌 Cash Flow Manipulation

Borrow short-term → boost CFO

Sell receivables

Delay payments



---

8️⃣ Quality Spectrum (VERY IMPORTANT)

CFA gives a hierarchy:

Highest Quality

1. Economic reality strong


2. Reporting transparent & compliant


3. Earnings repeatable + sustainable



Medium Quality

Interpretation difficult

Some grey-area accounting


Lowest Quality

Misleading information

Aggressive accounting

Fraudulent reporting



---

9️⃣ How Analysts Evaluate Reporting Quality?

1. Read footnotes carefully

Most manipulation yaha hide hota hai.

2. Review accruals

High accruals = suspicious earnings.

3. Consistency check

Policies same?
Assumptions same?

4. Cash flow vs net income compare

If net income >>> CFO → red flag.

5. Check revenue growth vs receivables

Receivables ↑ faster → fake sales possible.


---

🔟 FINANCIAL REPORTING VS EARNINGS QUALITY MATRIX

CFA diagram yaad rakh lo:

Reporting Quality	Earnings Quality	Result

High	High	Best scenario
High	Low	Company honest but business weak
Low	High	Suspicious results
Low	Low	Dangerous + avoid



---

1️⃣1️⃣ End Goal (CFA Exam Style Insight)

Chapter 10 me examiner mostly puchta hai:

Identify manipulation from data

Spot red flags

Separate earnings quality vs reporting quality

Short conceptual questions

Manipulation methods

Accounting warning signs


Yeh chapter purely conceptual hai —
toh tum ise easily master kar logi.


---

CHAPTER 11

---

1️⃣ Purpose of Financial Statement Analysis

Analyst statements ko use karta hai:

Performance evaluate karne

Credit risk judge karne

Equity valuation

Liquidity check

Profitability measure

Going concern test

Forecasting future earnings

Management strategy understand karna


CFA yeh chapter me sikhata hai:

👉 How an analyst READS data + ADJUSTS + INTERPRETS + FORECASTS.


---

2️⃣ Framework of Financial Analysis (MOST IMPORTANT)

CFA ke 6 steps — EXAM FAVORITE.

Step 1: Define the Purpose & Context

Investment type? (Equity, debt, acquisition, lending)

Time horizon?

Industry, company selected?

Constraints? (Risk, liquidity)


Example:
Lender → credit analysis
Equity investor → growth + value analysis


---

Step 2: Collect Data

Sources:

Annual report

Interim reports

Footnotes

MD&A (Management Discussion & Analysis)

Auditors opinion

Industry reports

Economic data


Note: Analyst ALWAYS confirms whether reporting is IFRS/GAAP & if auditor is clean.


---

Step 3: Process the Data

Yahan analyst sara magic karta hai:

Adjust financials

Convert LIFO → FIFO

Normalize earnings

Remove non-recurring items

Ratio analysis

Common-size statements

Trend analysis

Cash flow adjustments



---

Step 4: Analyze & Interpret

Use ratios to evaluate:

Profitability

Liquidity

Solvency

Efficiency

Growth

Cash flows


Identify:

Strengths

Weaknesses

Red flags

Opportunities



---

Step 5: Generate Conclusion & Report

Investor ke hisaab se recommendation:

Buy / Sell / Hold

Credit rating

Risk summary

Forecast

Valuation numbers



---

Step 6: Update (Follow-up)

Naye events se analysis update hota hai:

Quarterly earnings

M&A events

Credit downgrades

Economic shifts



---

3️⃣ Key Analytical Tools Used in FSA

1. Common-Size Statements

(Yeh exam me routine aata hai.)

Common-size Income Statement

Each item / Revenue
→ Helps compare with competitors

Common-size Balance Sheet

Each item / Total Assets
→ Shows capital structure & asset distribution


---

2. Vertical & Horizontal Analysis

Vertical: Same year, % of base item

Horizontal: Multiple years, growth trend



---

3. Ratio Analysis

(VERY VERY HIGH-YIELD)

A. Profitability Ratios

Gross margin

Operating margin

Net margin

ROA

ROE

ROIC

DuPont Analysis


DuPont Formula:
ROE = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Leverage


---

B. Liquidity Ratios

Current ratio

Quick ratio

Cash ratio

Defensive interval



---

C. Solvency Ratios

Debt-to-equity

Interest coverage

Financial leverage



---

D. Efficiency Ratios

Inventory turnover

Receivable turnover

Payable turnover

Total asset turnover



---

E. Cash Flow Ratios

CFO / Net income

CFO / Debt

Free cash flow



---

4️⃣ Financial Adjustments Analysts MUST Make

Ye chapter ka most important practical part:

1. LIFO to FIFO Adjustment

Inventory (FIFO) = Inventory (LIFO) + LIFO Reserve
COGS (FIFO) = COGS (LIFO) – Change in LIFO Reserve

FIFO usually ↑ profits & ↓ COGS.


---

2. Capitalizing vs Expensing

Agar koi company expense ko capitalize karti hai:

Assets ↑

Net income ↑ initially

Cash flow SAME

Future depreciation ↑


Analyst → expense ko normalize karta hai.


---

3. Operating Leases → Capital Leases

Convert karte waqt:

Assets increase

Liabilities increase

EBITDA increase

Debt ratios worsen



---

4. One-time items remove

Examples:

Restructuring

Litigation

Gains/losses

Impairments


Analyst core earnings calculate karta hai.


---

5️⃣ Forecasting Financial Statements (VERY CFA STYLE)

Analyst future income statement + balance sheet + cash flows estimate karta hai.

Steps:

1. Revenue forecast


2. Margins forecast


3. Operating cost forecast


4. Interest expense


5. Tax


6. Net income


7. Reinvestment needs


8. Capex / Working capital changes


9. Free cash flows



Forecasting is based on:

historical trends

management guidance

industry outlook

macroeconomic factors



---

6️⃣ Credit Analysis vs Equity Analysis

Equity Analyst Focus:

Profit growth

ROE

Competitive advantage

Valuation


Credit Analyst Focus:

Short-term liquidity

Leverage

Interest coverage

Default probability

Cash flow stability



---

7️⃣ Industry Structure & Competitive Strategy

Analyst ALWAYS checks:

Porter’s 5 Forces

1. Competition intensity


2. Supplier power


3. Customer power


4. Threat of substitutes


5. Threat of new entrants




---

Business Strategies

Cost leadership (low cost)

Differentiation (unique product)

Focus strategy (niche market)


Strategy impacts:

margins

asset turnover

risk

growth



---

8️⃣ Financial Modeling Red Flags

Analyst should suspect manipulation when:

Revenue ↑ but cash flow ↓

Inventory ↑ faster than sales

Receivables ↑ faster than revenue

Gross margin unstable

Frequent accounting changes

Very low depreciation

Very high capitalized expenses



---

---

📘 CH 1 — Financial Reporting Environment

Financial reports help with investment, credit, analysis decisions

Main statements: BS, IS, CFS, Equity, Notes

IFRS vs GAAP acceptable financial reporting frameworks

Qualitative characteristics: Relevance, Faithful representation, Comparability, Verifiability, Timeliness, Understandability

Constraints: Cost-benefit, Materiality



---

📘 CH 2 — Income Statement Basics

Revenue recognition: when earned + measurable

Expense recognition: matching principle

Non-recurring items → removed from core earnings

EPS (basic vs diluted)

Gross profit, operating profit, net profit structure



---

📘 CH 3 — Balance Sheet Basics

Assets = Resources controlled

Liabilities = Present obligations

Equity = Assets – Liabilities

Current vs non-current

Appropriate measurement bases: historical cost, fair value, amortized cost



---

📘 CH 4 — Cash Flow Statement

CFO: core business

CFI: investment in PPE, acquisitions

CFF: debt + equity transactions

Direct vs indirect method

Non-cash transactions are disclosed separately



---

📘 CH 5 — Inventories

Methods: FIFO / LIFO / Weighted Average

LIFO → higher COGS, lower profit (inflation period)

LIFO reserve = FIFO inventory – LIFO inventory

Inventory write-down required when NRV < cost



---

📘 CH 6 — Long-lived Assets, Depreciation

Depreciation methods: straight-line, declining balance

Impairment: carrying value > recoverable amount

Under IFRS: Revaluation allowed; under GAAP: not allowed

Capitalized interest → included in asset cost



---

📘 CH 7 — Income Taxes

Tax expense = Current tax + Deferred tax

Temporary differences → create DTA/DTL

Permanent differences → no deferred tax

Tax base ≠ carrying value → deferred tax



---

📘 CH 8 — Non-current Assets & PPE Advanced Topics

Revaluation gains → OCI

Impairment losses → P&L

Useful life change affects depreciation prospectively

Component depreciation (IFRS)

Capitalizing vs expensing affects NI, EBITDA, Assets



---

📘 CH 9 — Inventories, Revenue Recognition Manipulation

Red flags: channel stuffing, bill-and-hold, round-tripping

Inventory write-down reversals allowed (IFRS), not allowed (GAAP)

Revenue should reflect economic transfer of control



---

📘 CH 10 — Financial Reporting Quality

High-quality reporting = transparent + rule-following

Earnings quality = sustainable + repeatable

Earnings management types: income shifting, classification shifting, big bath, cookie jar

Red flags: high accruals, receivables ↑ faster than sales, margin jumps, frequent non-recurring items

Beneish M-score > –2.22 → possible fraud



---

📘 CH 11 — Financial Statement Analysis Applications

Adjustments:

LIFO → FIFO

Operating lease → capital lease

Remove one-time items

Normalize depreciation, interest


Forecasting future earnings & FCFF/FCFE basics



---

⭐ 2. FSA FORMULA SHEET (ALL EXAM FORMULAS)

(Just formulas — no theory — quick recall)


---

📌 Income Statement Formulas

Gross Profit = Revenue – COGS
Operating Income = Gross Profit – Operating Expenses
Net Income = EBT – Tax

EPS (Basic) = (Net Income – Preferred Dividends) / Weighted Avg Shares

Diluted EPS → Adjust for dilutive securities


---

📌 Liability & Asset Formulas

Asset = Liability + Equity

Ending Inventory (FIFO) = Ending Inventory (LIFO) + LIFO Reserve

COGS (FIFO) = COGS (LIFO) – Change in LIFO Reserve


---

📌 Depreciation

Straight-line = (Cost – Salvage) / Useful life

Double declining balance = 2 × SL rate × Book value

Units-of-production = (Cost – Salvage) × (Units used / Total units)


---

📌 Taxes

Tax Expense = Current Tax + Change in DTL – Change in DTA

Deferred Tax = Carrying value – Tax base


---

📌 Profitability Ratios

Gross Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue
Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue
Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue
ROA = Net Income / Total Assets
ROE = Net Income / Equity


---

📌 DuPont ROE

ROE = Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage


---

📌 Liquidity Ratios

Current Ratio = CA / CL
Quick Ratio = (CA – Inventory) / CL
Cash Ratio = Cash / CL


---

📌 Solvency Ratios

Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt / Total Equity
Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense
Financial Leverage = Total Assets / Equity


---

📌 Efficiency Ratios

Inventory Turnover = COGS / Avg Inventory
Receivable Turnover = Revenue / Avg AR
Payable Turnover = COGS / Avg AP
Total Asset Turnover = Revenue / Assets


---

📌 Cash Flow Ratios

CFO / NI
CFO / Debt
Free Cash Flow (FCF) = CFO – Capex


---

📌 Accruals

Accrual Ratio = (Net Income – CFO) / Average Assets
(Higher = lower earnings quality)


---

📌 Working Capital

Working Capital = CA – CL
Change in Working Capital = ΔCA – ΔCL


---

📌 Lease Adjustments

Capitalized Lease Asset = PV of lease payments
Lease Liability = PV of lease payments
→ EBITDA ↑, Debt ↑


---

📌 WACC

WACC = (E/V × Re) + (D/V × Rd × (1 – tax))


---
