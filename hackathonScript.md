🟦 SLIDE 2 — PROBLEM STATEMENT
⏱ 0:15 – 0:40
🎬 Change slide at 0:40
🎤 Speech

“Every student learns differently.
But our education system still teaches everyone the same way.

Some students struggle silently.
Some students finish early and lose interest.
Teachers managing large classrooms cannot track individual learning needs.

This one-size-fits-all approach creates learning gaps, stress, and low confidence.”

👉 Short pause → Change slide

🟦 SLIDE 3 — WHY THIS PROBLEM MATTERS
⏱ 0:40 – 1:00
🎬 Change slide at exactly 1:00
🎤 Speech

“This is not a small issue.

Millions of students study without knowing their weak areas.
Teachers spend more time evaluating than guiding.
Parents lack visibility into real progress.

If learning is not personalized, students either lose confidence or lose interest.
That is why this problem is urgent and worth solving.”

👉 Firm pause → Change slide

🟦 SLIDE 4 — PROPOSED SOLUTION
⏱ 1:00 – 1:25
🎬 Change slide at 1:25
🎤 Speech

“To solve this, we built an AI-Powered Adaptive Learning System.

Our platform continuously analyzes student performance —
accuracy, speed, and behavior —
and automatically adjusts learning difficulty in real time.

Instead of students adapting to the system,
the system adapts to the student.”

🟦 SLIDE 6 — HOW IT WORKS
⏱ 1:45 – 2:00
🎬 Change slide at 2:00
🎤 Speech

“Here’s how it works.

A student attempts questions.
The AI analyzes performance patterns.
Difficulty adjusts automatically.
Personalized content is delivered.

This loop continues until the student truly understands the concept.”
